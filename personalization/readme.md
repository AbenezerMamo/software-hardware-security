Jeff Bezos once made a great point about product v.s. customer discovery. I think we're at a tipping point with aggregation businesses and even verticalization where there could possibly be a convergence that makes way for self-selective curation as opposed to recommendation. Moee on this soon...

## Discovery

The problem with facilitating discovery is the same reason why Bill Gates can't appropriate more than 1% of his net worth: people with a power trip & natural human attraction take hold of good and honest intentions. No, giving 99% of your net worth doesn't buy you a moral free pass for life either. (Sorry he hired the youngest PM just to make me feel bad about being the 2nd youngest. See what I mean? :P Michael is a good kid and Spanish kids need an inspiration too. If only Google would stop being an @ by taking advantage of him to build the most controversial product. Homie, thank you but you didn't deserve the hit and people should have protected you better.) Anyway, there should be a 100 day cap on philanthropy, marketplace, & auction dynamic teams in my opinion. More developimg here soon....
