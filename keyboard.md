# Keyboard

If you're using a custom keyboard, turn the data access off, especially if it manages your pastebin (copy/paste). If you are using a custom keyboard to manage preconfigured text inputs, make sure you switch back to default keyboard after your special use case. Default keyboards are less prone to leaking the sensative content you type. If you're using a custom keyboard for gifs, search, or better finger/hand/gesture usability, make sure you be mindful of their data collection & usage settings. Simply put: I would trust the native stock keyboards over custom ones in case i forget thay I'm writing sensative content. If you are wondering why your stock keyboard sucks with some auto complete, swipe, & suggestion features, it's likely relying more on your own usage than shared global usage. Going forward, in device computation is more safe but you have to be okay with it being mediocure to start training it. If security and safety isn't top of mind and you care about custom workflows, make sure you be mindful of how and when you can ease back over time; it's not worth it. For some products and features, data is required but be sure to pressure them to clarify which specific features send data back to devs. In general, at least on iOS, sensative form fields default back to stock keyboard for a reason: to not allow bad actors to capture and save your password entries
