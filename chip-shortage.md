# Global Chip Shortage

## Abenezer Mamo (WiP)

One possible consideration for easing the growing demand pressure for chips is to ensure that you not only produce devices that could be recycled efficenieny for the most effective parts to be reused but to also encourage consumers to participate in trade-in programs that don't pose a risk for previous and new owners.

While personally an advocate for ambient computing with multi-user and just-in-session OS and application usage, I do recognize the myopic nature of Wall Street's measures and expectations that are orthogonal to sustainable innovation both for nature and nature's made. This is a larger problem I hope to contriubute to over time and one that won't be an over night solution or resolution. It will require not just the alignment of incentives but the seeding of new markets with new form of marketing all under completely new product, production, and sales cycles that genereate new lifecycles for hardware and product; exciting usage cycles for consumers and producers; and a fresh breath of air for policy makers to not lag behind the expectations of yesterday's challenges and tomorrow's open field.
