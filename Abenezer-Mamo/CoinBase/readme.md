# CoinBase

Hi Armstrong, found your moon yet?

Despite getting lots of negative press for diversity, I found myself at the recieving end of generousity & dignified respect from ex-Coinbase people. However, the guy who runs it is a complete * and an @ who rejected my offer to build the Web3's Chrome within Toshi / Wallet.

That being said, I keep my Bitcoin in CoinBase; an FDIC insured custodian whom I remind will lose the BitLicense it so values if it plays games.

In other news, go join CoinBase if you want a world class lesson on custodian, multi-sig, & why it's so damn hard to explain why culture is hard to set if you hire people who can't afford to express themselves. Coinbase, please for the love of God help these idiots solve wallet recovery since they can't get people to open their contact list to do social recovery. I choose to sit on the side and laugh as I eat my pop corn in NOT dark growth social tactics.
