# Communication

### Why now?

I plan on pissing off the CIA by creating a new class of comms protocols, networks, & platforms that they can't undermine.

### Who?

Not run by me

### When?

As soon as they stop trying to go after my friends, prob. The true cost of friendship is that you get blacklisted. Why do you think I was willing to share so much with you?

### How?

By building monetization & sustainable moderation from day 0 so I who ever runs it doesn't need to make deals with the devil

### Where?

Anywhere and eveywhere until 1 life lost, $1 untaxed, & 1 double agent shows up in your local. Then your entire region loses access.

### What?

It's like Simon says but even more powerful. I'm talkimg reccess, family gatherings, and even playgrounds. We call it....TagMe
