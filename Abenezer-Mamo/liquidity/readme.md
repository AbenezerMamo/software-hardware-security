# Liquidity Pools

If you intend on using gift cards to fund your degenerate trading zero-sum schemes, look over to Starbucks for how to be a darling. You leave yourself exposed for financial crimes, monetary policy tampering, & money transmition violations the DHS will definetly not be happy about. Starbucks has been at the forefront of lots of financial instruments, much like Valve, Goldman Sachs, PayPal, Visa, & Apple, and can serve as good examples for how to not expose yourself to risk that will corner you. For instance, the concept IPO only raised what it needed. 0x is filled with ex-Coinbase talent that aren't just ex-intelligence people; calm and wise in execution and protocol oversight. We entrepreneurs pay attention and choose harder paths over dark UX versions of economic principles & financial instruments / frameworks. Don't lose the long game. Don't be myopic. Don't let the speed of innovation strike fear into your responsibility to inspire, conspire, and perspire with your morals and ethics facing 1 direction and unwavering. Thank you in advance ;)
