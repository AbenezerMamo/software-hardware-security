# Abenezer Mamo

In an attempt to make this project flexible & adaptable to the much less entertaining & more dry humor of my friends and strangers, I'll establish a folder for myself to host my commentary, endless wit, & bountiful wisdom. So, let's establish the lines clearly. The no-nonsense cut clear dilligence, neutral and forthcoming oversight, and humble kindness expressed or implied by anyone else in this repo is not a reflection of me; nor will I let it rub off on me. I intend to undermine the weight & gravity that this effort will extend and accrue over time. Let me make that very very clear. I am NOT like "those" people and expect to be held to 0 degrees of your opinion & 360 of my freedom.

That said, I'm incredibly humbled and delighted to have you witness & benefit the amazing generousity and courage these people bring to this project and I hope you can show them the respect, credibility, & grace they are burning by being here in your favor & best interest. It means the world to me to collaborate with you talented folks and a living dream. Now let's back to it before I tear up. *ahem*

"Which asset do I really wanna chart? I got market moves trading like a BART..." Sorry, wrong repo...Let's begin.
