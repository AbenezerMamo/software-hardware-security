# Utility

## Abenezer Mamo

This document is a living testament to why I will not allow any commits to this project that don't pass my safety filter. This is one of those documents only I can afford to write because I have fear of the Lord; and therefore have been afforded wisdom. If i lose my life over this, then know that I demand there to be no investigations and ask for the one responsible to simply change without looking behind you - there won't be anyone there. Let's proceed...

### Why utility companies are scary

1. They can fry your balls with no trace
2. They can show up underneath your floormat
3. They can put you on Amber alerts, emergency broadcasts, & team up with the agency to really let you know what wireless means
4. They can start fires. jk. If you get it, you get it. If not, don't worry about it
5. They can strike fear into anyone. Anyone. Except me. I respect them but see them only as utility.

Let's proceed.

### Why utility companies are the future

From mobile devices to now literally lap-desk-tops, it's increasingly more clear that they run the game like Sim *da-dum-dish*

### Why utility companies?

They can operate under natural monopolies / non-rivalary / "good where we're at" rules

### Why utility companies need to be held accountable in United States of America?

It's a privilage & a right that they need to earn to operate without X-in-the-middle attacks to their operation, business, & employees

Lose that right and you might be surprised at how very nothing / 0 / null the law, policy, & market will do to protect them from all hell breaking lose until every single customer migrates to the protected, at peace, & respected utility companies. Bite me.

### Why utility companies deserve respect?

It's like running an exhange...You see a lot of sh*t go down and you simply shake your head and pray to God one of these kids builds an open source herd machine to rival all the volume washing. Oh yes, I went there.

Right, we're supposed to stroke *their* ego. No, I will wipe your entire market cap. Bite me.

Yeah, don't even think about it kid...or adult. This is one of those don't try this ever or even nightmare of it. Stick to your own stuff and let grown men fight.

### Why utility companies are key to market growth?

1. Over the air updates
2. Elon's plot to stream porn to your giant screen in the car
3. IoT
4. Just-in-time civic infra
5. Access > Ownership models that adhere to mechanism design
6. [More to add]

### Why polititians won't touch them

We have yet to make the FCC an independent branch. There are lots of complicated reasons why and why not that I'll save for my own folder. Nah, I don't do politics. Moving on...

### Why does it matter to you?

If Hollywood hasn't done a good job scaring you then let this be a rude awakwning: don't f*cking look, dig, or even talk at them, to them, or near them. If I haven't made that clear, let me say it again: DO NOT play games - they don't. I nor anyone will be able to dig you out of that one. If you see a van, a hat, a truck, a pole, a hole, or even a buzz...just keep your eyes, curiousity, & b.s. to yourself. Failing to follow this will leave you in a bad place. If I haven't scared you enough, then you are an idiot. I respect these rules best I can. In doing so, I hope and pray they protect me from the b.s. I can't even imagine people in and out try to pull. I don't ask, I don't demand, and I don't know. Moving on...


### What matters to consumers?

To me, I want to protect the market's independence from utility conpanies which I hope can in turn lead to more options and choice for you to have your Dollars & complacency do the bidding.

### What's your ask?

Less bundling, less bloatware, & more factory direct. God bless & thank you!
