One of the prized treasures we speak of in marketing is the magical consumer "foot traffic" *whispers and chatter sound effects ensue*

While a savage attempt to * on the industry that gave me a decade of adventures and MOAT, I do feel bad for how quickly marketing is forcing ads to adapt. What does worry me is the increasinngly anti-consumer rheteric and direction we're collectively driving towards (da-dum-dish). While an all too common method in insurance and highly-sensative / highly-optimized careers and industries, I am worried about the new applications and those who naively drive at full speed with blind disregard for the risk they pose to themselves; let alone their customers. I don't know much about this space and I need time to educate myself. In the meantime, I hope my fear is signal and a call for more research being done here. I am mindful of spreading FUD (fear, uncertainity, & doubt) and am aware of the knee-jerk reaction it might trigger across the board. I'm working on it and would like to develope a gradient to measure my own and another to communicate outwards. This of course is undermined by the outdated, incomplete, and sometimes just false or dead wrong information I operate off of. If it's the latter, please forgive me for it's not intentional. I would rather be called out on it sooner as to not damage the reputation & meaning of the efforts and time I put forth in good faith. Thanks! More on this when I'm ready
