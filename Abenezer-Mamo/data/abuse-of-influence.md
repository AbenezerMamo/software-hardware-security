# Yes, I'm talking about you (the rest of you)

Hi Alex & Nabil, I hope you can serve as model examples as roommates, friends *ahem*, & consumer monetization engineers...If you hear these two clowns tell you where they work / worked, remind them that their friend is dissapointed. If I avoided sliding into your girl's DMs and shaking down crypto chirpers, then they can pay full price for a meal or service and ocassionally get short end of the stick for working for a modern day mob shakdown of a biz. Sorry homies, I said I have no interest in remaining neutral. However, I do see you as brothers and am proud that tech is placing trust in us young folks to lead these clown farts with a compass

As I said before in this folder, it's important for the early pioneers of the tech industry to serve as role models because there is tremendous amount of trust and faith placed in us to not bring the behaviors, methods, & fears that are all to well known in organized crime; unless you're doing open source software and hardware security.

## Logs

## Calling on your homies for guidance

Cash Money

## West Coast / East Coast

I think you'd see a collab w/ Halo frisbies in the music video before you see me antagonize failed encryption protocols with hidden budget appropriation and document burning. Oh wait, that's the other guys...not the black community. I live on both coasts just fine and have yet to encounter a single instance of organized crime (sorry, not sorry). Thank you everyone I don't know and would like to socially distance. I am already catching enough sh*t for a laptop sticker...
