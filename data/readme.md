There is this really cool company that made web scrapping tools for those of us with morals. It's called import.io and they hosted Doug Laney to talk about data and the economics of it. Don't know much about him and haven't used the tools sincd pronably high school but he had something insightful to share about why it's unfair to compare data to oil. "Oil can only be used once but data is entirely a different catagory of economic principles."

I thought that was just darn brilliant and really made me think twice about how wealthy I really am having worked with data engineers, ads data, & timeseries applications (trading, marketplaces, & game servers)

Beyond flexing on you, I would like to offer it as evidence for why those of us with ethics don't cash in on our MOAT & leverage for a reason. At least for me: I don't want 1 life being the expense to help 1 Billion or to be first to make 1 Trillion.
