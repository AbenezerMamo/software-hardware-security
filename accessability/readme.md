# Accessability

Almost all of the accessability tools I've seen related to Voice Over are hidden tools for hackers and mal intentioned actors to gain access to your screen, keyboard, and behavior on your phone without alerting you.

I'll take the heat from the global community for those it hurts but those it damages is too much to bare to not say anything. Turn off Caps Lock key and disable any input feeback loops. If you care, then actually build safeguards and don't come at me with your moral stool. For those this affects, I'm deeply sorry and I know the world will make up for it.
