Apple Security thinks it's too good for me &amp; FBI doesn't reply to tips

# What this, I, nor my intentions are NOT

Free. Open Source. In good faith.

# Why now?

I am done with tech. I have no interest in helping you, empowering you, nor emboldining you.

All of this is in consumer interest and that alone.

I am also NOT interested in joining your agency nor your M&A scheme shop.

# How will this work?

Every commit will leave your company and your teams at the edge of their seats.

I suggest the following:

1. Get good
2. Improve your release cycles by pressuring your PMs so they can bully the eng teams. Power move.
3. Stop waiting for bad things to happen to react. Be proactive.
4. Get your morals and ethics aligned. Then maybe the intelligence community will help you by telling you about 0 days in the wild before an onion will. Which one? You decide.
5. Make your teams focus more on creating upside and bored kids will appreciate you by protecting your downside
6. I don't need the money and nor do the good guys out there particpating in your bounty programs. Grow the pie & make the market incentives work. 0 days can run a few billion to a state backed actor so be respectful and offer more than a few grand. Those that take it are trying to help you; again, you're the one being helped. Got that? Good.
7. Don't even try to hit up my friends for a job. Ask me directly for an intro or I'll blacklist you. Yes, influence. Power move. If you want to hire my friends, the deal better be sweet & you protect them like they're my own. Power moves.
8. I'm not for hire.

# Me

1. NOT for hire
2. Will s*it in you if you even dare to open a case
3. Have lots of people that will come out the dark in full force if you attempt to front run, spy, leverage, or do harm with my work or time. Love moves.
4. Yeah, idk man...I would do some Google or Ducking or Banging (let's make that a thing pls) before you consider your next moves

# What's next?

1. Core infrastructure that runs and powers your life: the consumer
2. Attempts at marketing & comms translation so media & policy can inform the public, shame the encumbants, & scare the living s*it out of all my old co-workers
3. Networking, OS, right to repair level, & adverserial game design proposals
4. Accessibility tools moderation & throttling so you kids can stop trolling and pissing off people who need them (for reasons I won't disclose: I too will be pissed off at you)
5. A global race to patch and tape already fragile systems. See? I have some humor too. It's okay, I'm not here to make your life harder fellow suit; just wanna make consumers dance.

# Pacing

Will not get ahead of my self nor let the ego trip lead me astray. My goal is to bring some shared understanding to how to have this civil conversation with Pixar attitude: no good or bad guy/gal/bot. I have no skin in the game nor a horse in the race. I can already beat you in the market by building a better product or service so this isn't my means of seeking a vandetta; unless you are making your logo into a lock or have something rising from the ashes while your star agent is feenin' for a hunt. That's as far as my wit, clapback, and trolling will go. From this point on, assume I'm as serious as a D round. Okay, done; I promise.

# First thing first

## Paths

A. Fix what's broken
B. Prevent further rampage
C. Set new standards
D. Lower the time to market, herd update (80% min), & standardization (hire, fire, & promote equivilant for security)
E. Product education (globalization makes this hard & so does an free market but we will try anyway)
F. Task your developer (Yes, this is a play on you know what but will not name. This creates beuracracy & internal chaos. Least preffered route)
G. Educate decision makers (Don't trust myself nor you with this level of influence so I'll leave this to media & policy makers)
H. Create a market for it (Beyond sounding smart, this is actually hard. I think seeding the market & establishing low hanging fruit incentives to multiply staffing externally is a good start)
I. T. Yes, dev ops is hard and someone needs to be on call all the time. Whatever you propose will take 10x longer, 2x the workforce, & be delayed by a multipe of your culture's health. Last one I'm actually interested in helping tackle.

## Request for Proposals

Not sure if a pull-push model is better or if a marketplace based on need-budget-scope will prevail. Obviously, this needs to favor the rich & powerful developers and researchers since they can be more picky. Attempting to hire or acquihire any contributor will get you blacklisted and we will make you lose the long game. Take your pick.
