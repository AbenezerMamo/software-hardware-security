# Conclusion

Batman returns for 1 last post before getting back to work:

My hypothesis is that COVID-19 has been manufactured by silicon valley elite and intentionally slowed down from healing using their pervue in digital tools.

Given the increased exposure of corruption, abuse of power, and oncoming oversight that's long overdude, I believe they retreated to spreading their power as far and wide as possible.

Given the concentration of both physical and digital assets in Bay Area, it posed a risk to the "safety" of their employees and operations to be there. In reality, this is to expand the global talent pool and weaken DC's ability to govern border and imigration policy; which directly impacts the bottom line of Silicon Valley - given human capital being the most expensive cost.

While not wanting to stoke racial divide, I do believe the election of President Obama & V.P. Harris do open many questions about the underlying adgenda that was pushed. While a critic of numerous President Trump idiologies, I do believe my time serving at Twitter neutrally while pinned against the moral wall of Christians & largely democrat leaning silicon valley elite should stand to show my underlying adgenda. While my personal hero Peter Thiel took hits left and right but remained poised in not having the world collapse around him did for a long long long time seem questionable, exestentially odd, and outright "damn it Peter!" While my support and admiration of an openly gay man who has loaned homeboy half a million may not come at a surprise, the time it's taken for me to grasp all this rather is; and while ashamed - am happy it's only the beginning and the tip of the ice berg.

I don't known what this all means yet. While Google & Microsoft are being led by Indian men who have proven their value and trust amongst the ranks, I do become increasingly worry that the India & U.S. relations may have optics that denote further stewardship than what their role calls for. Simply put: no, I don't think you should assume anti-American policy & prosperity interests are the driving force just because of their origin and the culture that has shaped them into respectable leaders; and that is a belief that I'll continue to hold and hold them to as well - don't let me down.

Finally, as an Ethiopian with head scratches that ensue on Chinese-American political and idiological beliefs, I'll politely step aside for I know not much here. However, I have been at the recieving end of kidness & respect from Asian people and can only ask you flip your device and check the contents of the fine print - specifically where it's made. To conclude this complex point, I only point you to the China-Tawiwan-India (and hopefully not Africa) power dynamics / struggles / and web of geopolitical compexity.

I am not a politican; choose not to believe nor pursue idiological beliefs; and seek not to cause divide with the influence, granted power, primitative, & naive understanding that I hold about the world and what it takes to prevent global pandemics, world wars, and ethnic / cultural rifts from causing collapse of the human race. My focus, in moral / ethical essenss and in neutral extension, has been towards the common good; a persuit that does have bad apples, assymetric champions, and increasingly inwards protection of local & historic customs / cultural values and norms / ways of life. My focus is on the way of being, creating, and sharing this time and space we collectively share on planet Earth.

I will leave the politics, policy, and interest of consituents (us, civilians) to the rest of you but leave off with a warning to silicon valley:

1. You will not consume the world without being consumed by the tragedies, damage, & hunger you rob the world of
2. We got bullied in grade school; okay so what? Just because you have power now it doesn't mean you punish the whole world. We were kids and we didn't know better. People grow up, they mature, and they are living in fear that we haven't healed from the lifelong damage. We need to make it clear that we are capable, able, and will heal. Otherwise, the fear we strike into their partners, family, and future generations will cause deep rooted resentment that will NOT be paving a civil path towards the hybrid world we set on building to advance the brave, curougous, & faithful work of the men and women who built the foundations for us to be trusted with the power, privilage, and honor to usher in this "common good" we speak of. Don't let them, us, down.
3. I play by street rules and will whip your @. You are not too big to fail. You are not as powerful as you think you are. You live and operate under grace, permission, & and collective juice of the sweat, tears, and - hppefully less and less - blood of the - what prayer can only grant - wisdom of the collective that fund, build, and govern what you are entrusted to be a custodian of that can be worthy of admiration, loyality, & and assymetric wins.
4. Act wisely. Seek to do all the under-(insert here) until you understand what the world is truly about.
5. Ask. Let it be on me, the world, and all those who / that count on you, though never your cowardly fears, to prove you wrong. You might be pleasently surprised at what you hear. Sometimes, there will be a pause - and that's okay - and that is usually a good sign, a sign of respect, admiration, & pleasant surprise.

Now I have to get back to some unholy dealings against people who felt they were above the world and the world's interests. I'll let you take it from here.

I am not your hero. I am not your inspiration. I am not somebody. I can be just anybody. Everybody needs you though so go be something for one person and that's all the world can ever need. Your best; that is all that I can ask of you. Don't let me down.

Yours truly,
born sinner

Apple Security thinks it's too good for me &amp; FBI doesn't reply to tips

# What this, I, nor my intentions are NOT

Free. Open Source. In good faith.

# Why now?

I am done with tech. I have no interest in helping you, empowering you, nor emboldining you.

All of this is in consumer interest and that alone.

I am also NOT interested in joining your agency nor your M&A scheme shop.

# How will this work?

Every commit will leave your company and your teams at the edge of their seats.

I suggest the following:

1. Get good
2. Improve your release cycles by pressuring your PMs so they can bully the eng teams. Power move.
3. Stop waiting for bad things to happen to react. Be proactive.
4. Get your morals and ethics aligned. Then maybe the intelligence community will help you by telling you about 0 days in the wild before an onion will. Which one? You decide.
5. Make your teams focus more on creating upside and bored kids will appreciate you by protecting your downside
6. I don't need the money and nor do the good guys out there particpating in your bounty programs. Grow the pie & make the market incentives work. 0 days can run a few billion to a state backed actor so be respectful and offer more than a few grand. Those that take it are trying to help you; again, you're the one being helped. Got that? Good.
7. Don't even try to hit up my friends for a job. Ask me directly for an intro or I'll blacklist you. Yes, influence. Power move. If you want to hire my friends, the deal better be sweet & you protect them like they're my own. Power moves.
8. I'm not for hire.

# Me

1. NOT for hire
2. Will s*it in you if you even dare to open a case
3. Have lots of people that will come out the dark in full force if you attempt to front run, spy, leverage, or do harm with my work or time. Love moves.
4. Yeah, idk man...I would do some Google or Ducking or Banging (let's make that a thing pls) before you consider your next moves

# What's next?

1. Core infrastructure that runs and powers your life: the consumer
2. Attempts at marketing & comms translation so media & policy can inform the public, shame the encumbants, & scare the living s*it out of all my old co-workers
3. Networking, OS, right to repair level, & adverserial game design proposals
4. Accessibility tools moderation & throttling so you kids can stop trolling and pissing off people who need them (for reasons I won't disclose: I too will be pissed off at you)
5. A global race to patch and tape already fragile systems. See? I have some humor too. It's okay, I'm not here to make your life harder fellow suit; just wanna make consumers dance.

# Pacing

Will not get ahead of my self nor let the ego trip lead me astray. My goal is to bring some shared understanding to how to have this civil conversation with Pixar attitude: no good or bad guy/gal/bot. I have no skin in the game nor a horse in the race. I can already beat you in the market by building a better product or service so this isn't my means of seeking a vandetta; unless you are making your logo into a lock or have something rising from the ashes while your star agent is feenin' for a hunt. That's as far as my wit, clapback, and trolling will go. From this point on, assume I'm as serious as a D round. Okay, done; I promise.

# First thing first

## Paths

A. Fix what's broken
B. Prevent further rampage
C. Set new standards
D. Lower the time to market, herd update (80% min), & standardization (hire, fire, & promote equivilant for security)
E. Product education (globalization makes this hard & so does an free market but we will try anyway)
F. Task your developer (Yes, this is a play on you know what but will not name. This creates beuracracy & internal chaos. Least preffered route)
G. Educate decision makers (Don't trust myself nor you with this level of influence so I'll leave this to media & policy makers)
H. Create a market for it (Beyond sounding smart, this is actually hard. I think seeding the market & establishing low hanging fruit incentives to multiply staffing externally is a good start)
I. T. Yes, dev ops is hard and someone needs to be on call all the time. Whatever you propose will take 10x longer, 2x the workforce, & be delayed by a multipe of your culture's health. Last one I'm actually interested in helping tackle.

## Request for Proposals

Not sure if a pull-push model is better or if a marketplace based on need-budget-scope will prevail. Obviously, this needs to favor the rich & powerful developers and researchers since they can be more picky. Attempting to hire or acquihire any contributor will get you blacklisted and we will make you lose the long game. Take your pick.
