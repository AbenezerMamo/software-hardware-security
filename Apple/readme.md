# Apple

## Introduction

While an advocate of open ecosystems and open source, I use Apple mobile devices primarily. For my laptop needs, I mainly use Windows though I've had Macbook Pro for iOS development. For everything in between, I've championed iPad OS since its introduction.

## Work & Play

I have no interest in remaining neutral and will advocate what I like and enjoy. What I leave out is likely because I haven't made the time to use or have had it wasted by shear incompetence or orthogonal usability. I invest my wealth & privilage in attempting to incorporate different consumer products into my workflow and lifestyle.

Since my professional & personal life are blurred in delination, I am personally offended by how pervasive iCloud has been through and through.   

That being said, I have found Apple's approach to on-device computing, secure enclaves, & segregation in premissioning across services to be world class and a gold standard for the industry. Much of my commentary here will fail to split between use cases and value prop so I apologize in advance. I hope to make this more clear over time.

## Risk tolerance

This is a good place to leave off and start level setting. Presidents, doctors, lawyers, journalists, & kids all place high premium here so let that be a guiding north star.
