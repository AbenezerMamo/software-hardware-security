# Listen to me very carefully. I will only warn you once.

If you choose to undermine public safety & trust by directing people to links with UTM params, redirects, or mal intentioned domains, I suggest you go look at my CNN documentary with Lisa Ling. Find the laptop sticker and then go look in the mirror. I will take a sponge and a Cascade until I end your dream's work. I will trace every packet, every bit, and every f*fking I.P. address until I render you null. If you don't believe me, ask around. Thank you and God bless.

Never. Ever. Again.
